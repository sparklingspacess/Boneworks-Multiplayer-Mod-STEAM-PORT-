# Boneworks-Multiplayer-Mod-STEAM-PORT-
Literally just a steam based port of Someone Somewhere's Boneworks Multiplayer Mod, nothing special (if you want the source code just use ilspy or something idk)

Instead of using Discord Networking for handling joining/leaving servers, it uses a steam-id based joining system (and also fixes some issues related to position networking between clients)

Thunderstore wouldn't let me upload this so I uploaded it here.

You can find the original github page here: https://github.com/s1sw/boneworks-mp

# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Put the ford.ford, steam_api64.dll, and discord_game_sdk.dll in your Boneworks directory (in the same location where the .exe file is for the game), put the Facepunch.Steamworks.Win64.dll file in the Managed folder that can be found in the MelonLoader folder (can be found in the game directory) then put MultiplayerMod.dll in your MelonLoader mods folder.
