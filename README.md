# Boneworks-Multiplayer-Mod-STEAM-PORT-
Literally just a steam based port of Someone Somewhere's Boneworks Multiplayer Mod, nothing special (if you want the source code just use ilspy or something idk)

Instead of using Discord Networking for handling joining/leaving servers, it uses a steam-id based joining system (and also fixes some issues related to position networking between clients)

Thunderstore wouldn't let me upload this so I uploaded it here.
